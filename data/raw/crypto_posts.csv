Institutions have killed the 'fun factor' in crypto this cycle,"Saylor says in one of his videos, that institutions like to buy when the volatility is low. That's when they can make big purchases. Tom Lee also said in an interview, that he prefers that the price stays low, but also doesn't reveal how they are purchasing so much ETH without affecting the price on the exchanges. 

The volatility is suppressed, and hence the price for bitcoin and eth (Wall Street is involved in mainly these two), leading to lackluster performance in other coins as well. There's absolutely no doubt that bitcoin and eth adoption is growing, and that institutions are gobbling up the supply.

I don't know how long this will go on for. At some point there will be a supply crunch. But it could take months. Because of low volatility, retail participation is also very low in this cycle, because there's just no excitement and FOMO. The moment there's good news and price goes up, Wall Street kills all the action. This sucks, but it's a reminder for us to just keep stacking.

"Borrow against my crypto to buy more crypto, easy money?","So i have some crypto for ease i will say i have 5 Ethereum and i recently find out that binance provide loans on crypto. 

I can borrow USDT at 5% annual rate against my ethereum, and use that usdt to buy more ethereum since almost all blue chip crypto give more than 5% annual gains 

I can borrow upto 70% of value to loan. 

E.g 70$ on 100$ worth ETH 

Why people just do not borrow at a very low rate like 40% of loan to value so you wont be liquidated and then use that money to buy more crypto? 

Even lets just say you get liquidated  the price of ethereum at that time will get you same almost same amount of ethereum because the interest rate is minute like tou have to pay around 50-100$ monthly only for 20k grand loan 

So in the end even if i get liquidated for say like after 3 months i can rebuy almost same amount of crypto and then hold it again like i was doing before

And considering crypto it sounds like extremely easy money? Because i am sure i can get more than 5% annual rate on my holdings. 

It sounds too easy which means i may be missing out something obvious ? 

Edit: @restore_democracy have explained it very well. 

I was thinking that i would be requiree to pay back in ETH + interest feee only rather than the USDT which i would have used to buy more ETH.

Trading game with cryptos,"Hey all,

Just wanted to stop by and share a project I've been working on for the past 3 months. It‚Äôs a trading game where you can practice trading crypto (and stocks) on real historical data. The game is still in beta, and I‚Äôm looking for users who‚Äôd like to try it out and share feedback while I keep building and improving it.

How it works:

* You‚Äôre given a random asset (crypto or stock) and cutoff date.
* You place a trade with optional stop loss & take profit.
* You fast-forward the chart until the outcome is reached.

No login or signup required to use the site. Ill drop the link to comments if anyone is interested.¬†Would really appreciate the feedback.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nrmtnb/trading_game_with_cryptos/,1758949939.0
Texit ‚Ä¶ Scam? Legit?,"Hey all

So a lot of people around me have been investing into Texit Coin and while on its face it‚Äôs one massive red flag with the MLM set up and all that‚Ä¶ the coin has pumped like 100% since I‚Äôve been looking at it and all those people are up a decent amount of money lol

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone in here is invested into Texit coin and are able to withdrawal money reliably etc and sell it quickly? There has to be some kind of catch or something I don‚Äôt understand how a coin with zero tech really and a btc copy could be already at 4 dollars a coin from like 2 dollars a few months ago and almost zero at the beginning of the year. 

Edit: Just so it‚Äôs more clear I do not own this coin or intend on buying in. The last sentence of the post really sums up the question, 

If a coin is ‚Äúvalued‚Äù at X amount and it‚Äôs available on a dex to swap into USDC are you actually able to trade it for its ‚Äúlisted‚Äù value?

"DeFi Education - Teller is different than traditional lending protocols (AAVE, Morpho, Compound, etc) and I'm quickly becoming a fan.","A couple months ago, Teller ran AMA on this subreddit and since then it‚Äôs become one of the protocols I use the most.

Bullet points on features I like

* TellerGPT¬†‚Äì Amazing for DeFi users. I don't know why every platform doesn't do this. I get a daily email with live pool conditions, yields, and borrowing options. It saves me a ton of time since I don‚Äôt have to check every dashboard on the platoform and  can just scan my inbox and know where the best opportunities are.
* Incentivized supply side yields¬†‚Äì So I am a big time katana user. Right now I‚Äôm earning \~25% APY on a couple assets (USDC & POL) simply by supplying the asset. The rewards are in-kind which is also really nice and avoids the BS that a lot of other lending protocols use.  The incentives make supplying compelling because the yield scales with borrowing demand, and it‚Äôs single-asset so I don‚Äôt deal with impermanent loss.
* No direct liquidations¬†‚Äì This is a massive differentiator. On Aave, Morpho, Compound, etc, if your collateral value drops too much, you get liquidated. This means is you're close to to your max LTV, you're constantly chart watching and nervous.  But with Teller, loans run on 30-day checkpoints, meaning as long as you pay the interest, your position stays open. If you miss the checkpoint, collateral goes into a Dutch auction where users bid on the collateral to reimburse the lenders. It‚Äôs way less stressful and lets you ride out volatility without getting wrecked by a random wick.

The last point is why Teller feels different to me. Aave, Morpho, and Compound are great, but they‚Äôre designed around constant price-based liquidations. Teller flips that model with checkpoint-based loans, and in my opinion, it‚Äôs a much better fit for more advanced strategies.

To me, Teller is perfect for a DeFi-first heavy user as it's designed more for long-term lending & borrowing strategies. 

A 30-day checkpoint is a really unique way to solve the high LTV problem in defi. Longer term, I think this model is set up well for on-chain credit systems once ZK-identity becomes more standard, as wallets can have credit scores attached to real identities (but obscured through zk-identity) meaning better borrowing terms for credible borrowers.  

Disclaimer: NFA & I wouldn‚Äôt recommend someone brand new to DeFi to dive in. But if you‚Äôve used Aave/Morpho/Compound/etc before,, Teller is absolutely worth a look.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nrchh7/defi_education_teller_is_different_than/,1758919463.0

Which tokenized stock platform is better: Ondo or Kraken‚Äôs xStocks?,"I‚Äôm trying to figure out which one actually feels more reliable in the long run. Both claim to be fully backed 1:1 by the underlying shares, but I‚Äôm curious what the community thinks when it comes to actual trust, transparency.

Ondo just launched global markets with 100+ tokenized US stocks and ETFs on Ethereum. They highlight that tokens are backed by real shares held with regulated broker-dealers, and they‚Äôve built in Chainlink oracles and Proof-of-Reserve feeds to improve transparency. On paper, that sounds very solid, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder how much of this comes down to ‚Äúwe have the right infrastructure‚Äù vs ‚Äúcan we really trust the custody chain if something breaks.‚Äù

Kraken‚Äôs xStocks (via Backed.fi) takes a similar approach. They‚Äôve got around 60 assets, trading 24/5, and recently expanded beyond Solana to Ethereum, BNB, and Tron. They emphasize secure custody and provide an on-chain Proof-of-Reserve dashboard. Plus, dividends are reinvested into the token automatically, similar to Ondo.

Both setups mean you don‚Äôt get shareholder rights like voting, so at the end of the day it‚Äôs mostly about exposure to price performance and dividends. That‚Äôs fine for me, but the bigger concern is whether these tokens can really be counted on in a stress scenario. What happens if there‚Äôs regulatory pushback, or if the custodian holding the shares runs into issues, or worse, and what‚Äôs the chance of this? Is one of these providers in a stronger position legally or structurally than the other? And more broadly, do you find Ondo or Kraken/Backed to be the more trustworthy option in practice? I also wonder if I‚Äôm missing other risks here, or if there are alternative tokenized stock projects worth considering beyond these two.

The few still true to Satoshis ideology of liberty, Roman Storm being a good example, are being imprisoned for ‚Äùmoney laundering‚Äù or ‚Äùrunning an unlicensed monetary service‚Äù while the so-called cryptobros couldn‚Äôt care less, so long as the value of their coins keep increasing on centralized KYC exchanges. 

Lastly, it‚Äôs a kind of poetic tragedy that the only cryptocurrency truly used as money is the one being blacklisted or banned in most countries.

The Future Of Gaming,"Since the beginning of time, people have searched for ways to be entertained. Games have always been at the heart of that search, challenging us, connecting us, and giving us a sense of achievement.

Now, with the rise of blockchain and Web3, gaming has evolved into something much bigger. We‚Äôre no longer just playing for fun, we‚Äôre playing for ownership, for rewards, and for the chance to shape the very worlds we spend time in.

Crypto gaming brings a new layer of value: players can earn while they play, trade in-game assets, join or form communities, and even build new experiences within larger ecosystems. Some approach these games to dominate and compete, while others focus on collaboration, growth, and long-term value creation.

What makes this space unique is that it‚Äôs no longer just about developers making games, it‚Äôs about players becoming creators too. With open ecosystems, anyone can contribute, launch their own ideas, and get rewarded for it. Every new project, every new game, is part of a shared purpose: to entertain, empower, and expand what gaming can mean.",http://medium.com/@cryptoroyale/the-future-of-gaming-b60d527a4c70,1758855085.0
What‚Äôs your view in ASTER? Are you buying it?,"Just saw this coin the day before yesterday and bought at $1.7 I sold at $2.1 and made a 50 dollar profit. Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking of changing strategy. My portfolio is 85-90% Litecoin (already sold my BTC, BNB, ETH, and SOL to buy Litecoin) because I think it‚Äôs pretty solid (commodity, fixed supply, fast, MWEB, treasuries, soon ETF, and most important, cheap). I‚Äôm of the philosophy of selling the winners to buy the losers because it‚Äôs easier for a 10B marketcap coin to double than it is for Bitcoin to do the same in the same timeframe. I think many people agree with this (otherwise, memecoins wouldn‚Äôt be so popular) and also that PoW coins with a fixed supply that have stayed in the market for more than a decade are solid investments. Unfortunately, my thesis proved wrong because LTC has underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm not selling it this cheap and have already holded it from $50 to $114 to $50 to $140 to $70 to now. So I‚Äôll just stay invested there. 

My question though, is about the remaining 15% of my porftolio. My best investment was Injective which I bought with $500 (less than 1% of my portfolio) because I liked the logo and it did a 100x from $1 to $53. Following the same train of thought, I bought OSMO (a Cosmos coin) with part of the profits from INJ but it was the WORST investment. It‚Äôs breaking all time lows every day. It‚Äôs sitting at a 100M marketcap and I fear it will be delisted or the developers may abandon the project and leave it to die. I‚Äôm not a fan of selling coins cheap but I already lost faith in the coin because unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or even Solana, it‚Äôs not of interest to any institution and doesn‚Äôt seem to have a floor. I was thinking of selling the OSMO to buy ASTER at $1.7.

Aster is pretty high in marketcap so in theory it‚Äôs harder to make a profit but a big marketcap can also be a positive because the coin has ‚Äúproven itself‚Äù (psychology) and, most important, it‚Äôs backed by CZ. If he‚Äôs promoting it so much, it feels like a legit project. I don‚Äôt trust Binance with my life but the guy sent BNB from 10 cents to 1K and has built a crypto empire. I think $ASTER is here to stay and could double this year, if not more. And even if the bear market comes, I think it would drop less than OSMO. 

What do you guys think, should I pull the trigger and buy ASTER? Are you buying at these prices? Or are you out already? Or do you think it‚Äôs not a good project and better to just buy gold or have USDT? I need to make a 2X to recover my losses from OSMO.

I‚Äôm a newb and almost got scammed but did some due diligence!,"I‚Äôm sure this is nothing surprising for the more seasoned people in this sub, but I am writing this just to warn other noobs who may come across a similar situation.

I was watching a crypto YouTube news channel, and one of the comments asked if anyone knows of a good trading mentor. Several of the replies to the comment mentioned a particular individual and praised him. People asked for further info and one of the commenters put the Telegram link to the said mentor. I ended up writing to this individual. He replied back to me within a few hours. His coaching program seemed quite enticing as it involved learning by trading with him in real time for 1 hour at a time where he would take 10% of your earnings. He was recommending minimum $20k but ideally $50k to start. $20k is on the very high end for someone like me so I decided to try to do some research on him‚Ä¶

I wasn‚Äôt able to find any information on him in a Google search. His Telegram account had just a few posts and they didn‚Äôt seem in depth or high-quality. So I decided to go back to the comments section of the YouTube video and look at the profiles of the person who asked for a mentor as well as the replies. The YouTube account of the initial comment had just been created that very day the video was uploaded (yesterday). The handful of replies from different accounts recommending or asking about this particular trader were all created on the exact same day early this year. What are the odds of that?

After the initial excitement about the offer and potential upside of the deal last night, I woke up this morning feeling a bit uneasy about the large amount of money (for someone like me), the use of Telegram which I haven‚Äôt used much, but have heard of the platform being used for scams. I‚Äôm glad I did some digging so I didn‚Äôt get scammed or at the very least wasted more time. Regardless, I learned a very valuable lesson very early in my investment/trading journey before putting in any money into anything. Going forward, I will be extremely diligent and skeptical about anything that sounds too good to be true or cannot be verified by multiple legitimate sources. üôè ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nqk476/im_a_newb_and_almost_got_scammed_but_did_some_due/,1758838019.0

Dont use PayPal - account block,"I put a portion of my crypto into PayPal as a way to diversify where my crypto in case there is an issue taking crypto out from a platform. My main storage is cold wallet but i do keep some on exchanges and it helps when i need to trade.

Last night, i went ahead wanted to send crypto to my Metamask and it popped up a message ""We can't transfer your crypto just yet"". I thought ok weird I didnt get any communication about this so it must be technical difficulty. I waited till the morning after and same issue. I called PayPal and someone said that because there is ""security system"" it froze the feature my crypto account of PayPal that allows me to transfer to another wallet. I was told that because it was done by ""security system"" there is nothing i can do but pray and hope that ""security system"" will unfreeze my account features in 7 days. I was also told that my other option if i was in a hurry was to just try and see if i can exchange for cash and withdraw but they werent sure i could. 

Now im not dumb and i know that selling for cash is considered a taxable event where im at. I dont prefer to take a tax hit just because their system found something suspicious on my account. All i did was fund metamask and my trading account where i trade crypto sometimes. All trustworthy companies that have been around for 8+ years. 

Bottom line is this is not acceptable to do without any communication or a way to resolve it. Im really disappointed in PayPal as i have using them for cash transaction for 20+ years.

"Join the Makina AMA, and discover the DeFi Execution Engine","Makina (r/Makina) enables professional fund managers to deploy cross-chain, sophisticated, and risk-adjusted strategies onchain in a non-custodial way, while opening access to everyday crypto and DeFi users. On September 29 we launch Season 0, where we bootstrap network liquidity and align before the ICO. Ask us anything now and find out how to make the most of Season 0 before we go live on Sept 29.

**What is Makina and why is it relevant to the sub?**  
Makina is a DeFi Execution Engine that connects professional strategists (Operators) with onchain users through programmable vaults called Machines. The first Operator that will deploy on Makina will be Dialectic, an industry-leading crypto-native fund.Machines are designed for institutional-grade yield strategies that anyone with a wallet can access. Risk management is enforced onchain with pre-approved instructions, parameter caps, atomic unwinds, and a lot of other innovative tech.

This is relevant to the sub because it tackles issues that matter in DeFi today: yield, transparency, risk management, fair launches, and execution infrastructure.

**What‚Äôs happening now?**  
On September 29 at 12:00 UTC we launch Season 0. This is your chance to acquire Machine Tokens (MT) and participate in Makina‚Äôs launch while earning:

\- Base yield from selected Morpho vaults (Steakhouse USDC, MEV Capital WETH, Gauntlet WBTC Core).

\- Tickets: Tickets give priority ICO access at $35M FDV (the same valuation as our strategic angel round).

\- Points: Points convert to $MAK tokens at TGE + leaderboard perksSeason 0 runs for 4 weeks. Early participation brings higher reward boosts. Your boost depends on when you join and how you position your Machine Tokens.

**Why are we here?**  
We want to share details of how Season 0 works, explain why institutional-grade execution infrastructure is missing from today‚Äôs DeFi stack, and hear directly from the r/cryptocurrency community.

**Topics we‚Äôd love to dive into (but not limited to):**

\- Mechanics of Makina‚Äôs Season 0, Tickets, Points, ICO, and Boosts.

\- What makes Makina uniquely positioned to transform DeFi operations?¬†

\- Makina‚Äôs technical innovations.

\- Risk frameworks and Operator alignment.

\- How fair launch values shape the $MAK distribution.

\- The role of Machines in scaling cross-chain strategies.

\- What comes next after Season 0?

*Season 0 is just the start. Positioning now means you'll be ahead of the curve for the Priority ICO*

Are Tokenized Stocks the next step for crypto,"I have noticed more exchanges moving into tokenized RWAs, and Bitget recently launched perpetual index futures tied to tokenized stocks, which shows how quickly the overlap between traditional finance and crypto is growing. These onchain assets are already seeing notable price action, highlighting that this isn‚Äôt just theory, it‚Äôs live market activity.

Take Intel tokenized stock (INTCon), for example. It closed up 6.41% at $31.22 after Micron‚Äôs strong Q4 earnings and raised 2025 guidance. Momentum was further supported by a $5B Nvidia stake, government backing for Intel‚Äôs foundry and AI initiatives, increased ASML High-NA EUV orders, and a Benchmark upgrade that pushed its price target to $43.

Marvell (MRVLon) has also drawn attention after announcing a $5B stock repurchase program, with $300M already executed this quarter. Meanwhile, Baidu (BIDUon) surged 7.39% to $134.86 after its Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing service secured Dubai‚Äôs first urban autonomous driving test licenses, an important milestone that strengthened its global AI and mobility presence.

Tokenized assets like these highlight how crypto markets are expanding beyond native tokens and DeFi into real-world equities.

Only hold now what you‚Äôre willing to hold 4 more years.,"This is not a prediction. Nobody knows the future. This post is about what to do in the face of that uncertainty.

This week marks the end of the Bitcoin cycle, which has been an uncannily accurate indicator of the tops and bottoms. Historically, the top has landed roughly 520-30 days since the halving - today is # 524‚Ä¶

That is the best, most reliable data anyone in the world has to guide their strategy here - nobody knows more than that.

Some people say this time will be different - alt season is coming around the corner. That‚Äôs a blind guess at best. They could be right - but it doesn‚Äôt seem like a mere coincidence that crypto markets are crashing this week.

Again, this isn‚Äôt advice to buy or sell - I‚Äôve held through some crypto winters and I‚Äôve sold the peak of some crypto summers.

Whatever strategy you choose, be prepared to be wrong. The key to wealth building is knowing how to manage when things don‚Äôt go the way you thought.

So far I have learned the following and I want to find out if others in here are doing the same: 

*  Keep your UTXO Management in check - Make sure to be aware of consilidating, you're future self with fees and privacy will thank you. 
* No address re-use - Always make sure to use a new address. 
* Don't leak IP-infos - Use a VPN or the Tor browser. 
* Utilize mixers - making your transaction even more private.

Stable coins backed by Gold? ROAST ME,"Is this possible? 

So I‚Äôve been going down a rabbit hole lately on stablecoins that aren‚Äôt pegged to fiat but to gold.

The idea sounds kind of old-school but also interesting: instead of trusting a central bank‚Äôs monetary policy (like with USDT or USDC, which rely on the USD), these coins are supposedly backed by actual physical gold stored somewhere. Basically, digital tokens representing grams or ounces of gold.

A few that I came across:

PAX Gold (PAXG)

Tether Gold (XAUT)

Digix (though I think it‚Äôs not very active anymore)


Couple of things that make me curious:

Do people here actually trust the ‚Äúbacking‚Äù? Like, is the gold really sitting in a vault and can holders redeem it?

Wouldn‚Äôt gold-backed coins be more resistant to inflation, at least compared to fiat-pegged stablecoins?

At the same time, doesn‚Äôt this introduce old problems (storage, custody, centralized trust) back into crypto?

And in a world where BTC already exists as ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù is this even necessary?


Part of me likes the idea that if USD collapses, these coins would still hold value because‚Ä¶ gold. But then again, if you‚Äôre already in crypto for decentralization, trusting a vault somewhere in London or New York feels ironic.

Anyone here actually holding or trading gold-backed stables? Do you see them as a hedge, or just another shiny marketing angle?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1nq6oz2/stable_coins_backed_by_gold_roast_me/,1758806695.0

Hilbert is a Nasdaq-listed quantitative fund built on algorithmic trading and disciplined risk management. Until now, their focus has been on Bitcoin and Ethereum only. 

Adding Concordium shows they see $CCD as the next big play in institutional adoption.

**Why $CCD** üëá
‚úÖ Identity built into the protocol
‚úÖ Protocol-Level Tokens powering stablecoins
‚úÖ Compliance-ready rails for global settlement

As CEO of Hilbert, Barnali Biswal said: *‚ÄúVery few projects meet our standards. Concordium stands out.‚Äù*

With MiCA and the GENIUS Act reshaping digital finance, compliance is the baseline. Hilbert‚Äôs entry proves Concordium is positioned to lead the next era.
