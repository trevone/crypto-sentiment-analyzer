Perfect — I’ll take the lead and map this out into a **clear roadmap** so we can stitch your working pieces (sentiment analysis, wallet connect, Candy Machine) into a real product.

---

## 🧩 Your Project Big Picture

**Goal:**
Crypto sentiment analyzer app where:

* Anyone can try the free tier (basic sentiment charts).
* NFT holders (minted via Candy Machine) unlock subscription features.
* Wallet connection (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) handles authentication.
* Backend runs your sentiment analysis and gates routes by NFT ownership.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap (Step by Step)

### **Phase 1 – Candy Machine Integration**

1. **Frontend Mint Button**

   * Connect Phantom wallet.
   * Button calls backend or Candy Machine directly.
   * Transaction signs in the user’s wallet.

2. **Backend Mint Support (Express + Solana Web3.js)**

   * Endpoint `/mint` → takes wallet address, calls Candy Machine program.
   * Returns tx signature for frontend to confirm.

---

### **Phase 2 – NFT Gating**

1. **Backend Middleware**

   * Endpoint `/check-subscription` → checks if a wallet owns a token from your Candy Machine’s collection.
   * Uses Metaplex JS SDK or Solana RPC to verify.

2. **Frontend Route Guard**

   * If no NFT → show “Subscribe” page (with mint button).
   * If NFT present → unlock paid-tier sentiment dashboards.

---

### **Phase 3 – Sentiment Analysis Features**

* Hook your **Reddit sentiment pipeline** into the gated dashboard.
* Free users → maybe get daily aggregate chart.
* NFT holders → advanced charts (pie charts, trendlines, per-token sentiment, historical data).

---

## 🛠 Tech Plan

* **Frontend:** React + Phantom Wallet Adapter
* **Backend:** Node.js / Express with Solana Web3.js + Metaplex JS SDK
* **Blockchain:** Candy Machine v3 on devnet (mainnet later)
* **Storage:** Arweave (NFT metadata/images), Redis/DB if needed for caching sentiment data

---

## ✅ Immediate Next Step

Now that Candy Machine is live, we need to choose where to start wiring it in:

1. **Mint Endpoint (Backend-first):**
   Write an Express route `/mint` → calls Candy Machine → returns transaction for wallet.

2. **Mint Button (Frontend-first):**
   Add a “Subscribe via NFT” button that connects Phantom and hits the backend.

---

👉 My recommendation: start with **backend minting** (so we can test with Postman/cURL first, then wire frontend).

Would you like me to draft the **Node.js Express route `/mint`** that mints from your Candy Machine (`92yg51De5DwXfniRAfBNRjGq89RPmfEyPL6nVw8MCSJs`) on devnet?
